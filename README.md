# So...it's Tic Tac Toe.

Yup, Tic Tac Toe...With a hip-hop theme for a little flavor. 

Specifically, a theme grabbed from a perennial debate in the culture: 

Big vs. Pac.

## How it works

Players choose Big or Pac. First person to choose goes first.

The grid emerges and players click a cell to fill with Big or Pac, respectively. To win, a player must have her/his mark in 3 cells in a row. The first player to do this wins.

In the space above the grid, players are prompted to choose, play, choose another cell, etc., and also, who has won and...what it means...

### Bugs

Clicking on a cell that has already been chosen should prompt a player to choose another cell, but doesn't always.

The AI version, in which the player competes against the computer, is a work in progress. Keep posted!
